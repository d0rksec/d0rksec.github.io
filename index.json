What would the query for fetch look like? The actual code of backend application would depend on what language (php, python, etc.) was used, but there are some common steps one would follow.\nPut the value of (image) id= parameter into a variable Create a database connection - this includes hostname/IP, database name, username, password, maybe a port number if not using the default (more here) Construct the sql query - it can take multiple steps and variables for complex queries Run the query with a function Use a function to fetch the query result In our case, the query will look something like this:\nSELECT data FROM table WHERE id=$id\nHint1: Take a few minutes to consider the state of the union As the original query returns data from one column, we can add another column with union. Quick recap on union.\nIn the source code we see that images are loaded with \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;fetch?id=1\u0026quot;. Let\u0026rsquo;s check if fetch parameter is prone to union attack.\n/fetch?id=1 will load the raw image. /fetch?id=1 order by 1 still works, however, with order by 2 (and above) it throws an Internal Server Error. /fetch?id=1 union select null also loads the raw image, ISE for select null,null. By reflex, one would try to call the missing image with /fetch?id=3 to see the result (Internal Server Error). Maybe check, if something is hidden with a higher index number?\nJust catch the request with Burp, pass it to Intruder and leave id=ยง3ยง as payload position. On the Payloads tab, load some wordlist containing numbers and start attack.\nThe results show that id 1 and 2 will result a 200 OK, id 3 will throw a Server Error and all other values will drop a 404.\nHint2: This application runs on the uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker image Google for \u0026ldquo;uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker\u0026rdquo;. Check the GitHub and the Docker pages.\nAs we can read in the description, \u0026ldquo;This Docker image allows you to create Flask web applications in Python that run with uWSGI and Nginx in a single container.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the How to use section on the Docker page we can see that\n\u0026quot;By default it will try to find a uWSGI config file in /app/uwsgi.ini.\u0026quot;\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can retrieve this file with a union query. Use a value for id anything that would drop a 404 (see above) to get clear output of the file contents.\n/fetch?id=4 union select 'uwsgi.ini'\nThe application\u0026rsquo;s name is main (.py)\nAlso, in the Quick start section of the GitHub page, the first example is about how to create an application called main.py (in case we have to guess).\nWe can now retrieve this file too, with the first flag:\n/fetch?id=4 union select 'main.py'\nFlag1 Hint0: I never trust a kitten I can\u0026rsquo;t see Yes, the third picture missing. Reasons could be:\nThe file path, stored in the database does not match with the filename The file path is okay, but there is no file uploaded The file path does not fit to the data type of the column \u0026hellip; Hint1: Or a query whose results I can\u0026rsquo;t see, for that matter /fetch?id=3 is throwing an Internal Server Error.

The query behind the scenes is\nSELECT password FROM admins WHERE username='[username field]' AND password='[password field]'\nOur Union-based payload will replace the second part of the original query, from the username\u0026rsquo;s closing ', something like this:\nSELECT password FROM admins WHERE username=' [payload]\nAs we need only one column, let\u0026rsquo;s set a fix value for password that we will provide in the password field (no username needed):\nSELECT password FROM admins WHERE username=\u0026rsquo; ' UNION SELECT '123' AS password#\nUsername: ' UNION SELECT '123' AS password# #you don\u0026rsquo;t need uppercase letters..\nPassword: 123\nHere you can see a more detailed answer on why/how above query works.\nIf you catch the request in Burp, you\u0026rsquo;ll see this:\nusername=%27+union+select+%27123%27+as+password%23\u0026amp;password=123 Fantastic, we\u0026rsquo;re in:\nHint2: Knowing the password is cool, but there are other approaches that might be easier After logon, an additional page is added to the links: /page/3, which was forbidden before.\nThe page reveals the first FLAG.\nAlternatively, we can also reveal this FLAG with sqlmap, when fetching pages table:\nsqlmap -r ~/h101/micro-cms_v2/login.txt -D level2 -T pages --dump --random-agent --threads 10 See more details for sqlmap in Flag2.\nFlag1 Hint0: What actions could you perform as a regular user on the last level, which you can\u0026rsquo;t now?

We can change request method to POST with -X POST.\nHint2: Different requests often have different required authorization Burp (intercept the request):\ncURL:\nChange the request method from GET to POST.\nBurp:\nAnother FLAG.\ncURL:\nFlag2 Hint0: Credentials are secret, flags are secret. Coincidence? We already know that the login fields are vulnerable for injection, but an SQLi challenge wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be complete without using sqlmap - also, there is much to learn even from it\u0026rsquo;s output.\nFirst, I\u0026rsquo;ve saved the GET request with Burp Intercept as login.txt (username=user and password=pass).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see how sqlmap is listing databases.\nsqlmap -r ~/h101/micro-cms_v2/login.txt --dbs --random-agent --threads 10 We have the database name (level2), now get the tables with:\nsqlmap -r ~/h101/micro-cms_v2/login.txt -D level2 --tables --random-agent --threads 10 Let\u0026rsquo;s dump admins table.\nsqlmap -r ~/h101/micro-cms_v2/login.txt -D level2 -T admins --dump --random-agent --threads 10 Using the credentials above for login, we see the third FLAG.\nTakeaway(s) Use \u0026ldquo;Incorrect username and/or password\u0026rdquo; instead revealing which of the two fields has invalid value Try changing request method between GET and POST Don\u0026rsquo;t rely on automated tools, understand what they are doing Experience with different tools for the same task ","permalink":"https://d0rksec.github.io/writeups/h101/micro-cms_v2/","summary":"Improved CMS with password authentication","title":"Hacker101 - Micro CMS_v2"},{"content":"What A small webshop with username/password authentication to crack.\nDifficulty: Easy\nFlag0 Hint0: Something looks out of place with checkout Let\u0026rsquo;s fire up Burp, set Scope, turn off intercept and just walk through the application.

They also tend to share common names, like /admin.php.\nTo access admin pages, users must authenticate themselves, using pages like /login.php.\nHint1: Tools may help you find the entrypoint Sure.

Better practice is to show \u0026ldquo;Invalid username or password\u0026rdquo;, as the attacker has to brute force all combinations of usernames and passwords.\nIn our case, we have to find a correct username first, then we can go for the valid password.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll brute force username with Hydra, using a wordlist for usernames from SecLists.\nhydra -L ~/repo/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -p \u0026#34;password\u0026#34; IAMSOSORRY.ctf.hacker101.com https-post-form \u0026#34;/login:username=^USER^\u0026amp;password=^PASS^:Invalid username\u0026#34; We\u0026rsquo;be got the username.

Can you figure out what it is? Deleting a post will pass the post id to /index.php?page=delete.php page as a hashed value.\nWe can guess from the same post\u0026rsquo;s edit link in the above line (/index.php?page=edit.php\u0026amp;id=4), that the hashed value will be close to 4, but to be sure, I\u0026rsquo;ve checked it on this page:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s delete Admin\u0026rsquo;s Hello world post, which has an id=1. Using the command from previous Flag:\necho -n 1|md5sum Our URL will be:\n/index.php?page=delete.php\u0026amp;id=c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b\n\u0026hellip; resulting the last FLAG!\nTakeaway(s) Look for easy to guess passwords Check if you can tamper with input parameters Broken authentication (can access other user\u0026rsquo;s private content) Use automated scanning to check missed pages (due to high page id or other weird stuff) Weak encryption (md5) used in cookie for authentication id to obfuscate link ","permalink":"https://d0rksec.github.io/writeups/h101/postbook/","summary":"Small PHP site with private/public posts to play with","title":"Hacker101 - Postbook"},{"content":"What A small CMS, with very basic functions.\nDifficulty: Easy\nFlag0 Hint0: Try creating a new page Hit the link Create a new page. Fill out title and content. Click Save button to create the page. Hint1: How are pages indexed? Pages are indexed with ascending numbers in a form of /page/$ (like *.ctf.hacker101.com/page/1, /2, etc.)\nHint2: Look at the sequence of IDs Testing is /page/1.\nMarkdown Test is /page/2.\nThe page we have created starts at */page/11.\nWhat is between page/2 and page/11?\nHint3: If the front door doesn\u0026rsquo;t open, try the window Edit the page ID in the address bar and open page/3, page/4, etc.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll find that /page/5 is Forbidden.\nHint4: In what ways can you retrieve page contents? When you open /page/1 (Testing) or /page/2 (Markdown Test), or on the page you\u0026rsquo;ve created, see that link Edit this page? Open any pages above for editing and check the URL! It is /page/edit/$.\nChange the ID to 5 (/page/edit/5) and collect the first FLAG. Flag1 Hint0: Make sure you tamper with every input What inputs do we have on this site (make a habit of manually looking around on a site)?\nThere are form inputs on Edit Page (/page/edit/$) and on Create Page (/page/create):\nTitle: \u0026lt;input type=\u0026quot;text\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\nText: \u0026lt;textarea name=\u0026quot;body\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\nHint1: Have you tested for the usual culprits? XSS, SQL injection, path injection XSS has worked only on Title field (see FLAG2). There is a comment under the textarea: \u0026ldquo;Markdown is supported, but scripts are not\u0026rdquo;.\nFor SQL injection, see last hint.\nNo luck with path injection.\nHint2: Bugs often occur when an input should always be one type and turns out to be another Title field expects text, javascript worked here (see FLAG2).\nBody textarea accepts only markdown, javascript filtered there.\nURL expects only numbers as page ID.\nHint3: Remember, form submissions aren\u0026rsquo;t the only inputs that come from browsers \u0026hellip; Also, there is the address bar in the browser.\nPut a single apostrophe (') after the page\u0026rsquo;s URL in the address bar, like /page/edit/1' for the FLAG.\nThis simulates the case when a page ID (in this case \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo;) is processed by a backend script and used in an SQL query without sanitizing it first. See more on SQL injection (a very basic injection would be something like /page/edit/1' or 1=1; --), but here, to get the flag, a single apostrophe is enough. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried some basic injection after it without luck.\nFlag2 Hint0: Sometimes a given input will affect more than one page The first input I\u0026rsquo;ve tried has resulted in a FLAG.\nOpen a page for editing, then insert \u0026lt;script\u0026gt;alert('1')\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; into the Title field:\nCreate the page.\nHint1: The bug you are looking for doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in the most obvious place this input is shown You are inserting the XSS on some page\u0026rsquo;s Title field. If you reload the page, nothing happens. Try navigating to the Home page :)\nHome page lists the page titles in an unordered list. List items use Title field values without satitation. This is where our payload kicks in.\nFlag3 Hint0: Script tags are great, but what other options do you have? Using markdown, you can insert URLs, buttons, images on the page.\nIf you load Markdown Test page (/page/2), there is an example for an image (broken) and a button element.\nEdit the page.\nLook up on HTML/JS reference, what inline options you have for a button tag. I\u0026rsquo;ve inserted onclick=\u0026quot;alert('3')\u0026quot; here.\nSave the page, XSS would just work fine. But where\u0026rsquo;s my FLAG?\nCheck the source of the page to get your last FLAG!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also tried XSS on the image element, following this link, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t manage to make it work.\nTakeaway(s) Manually try all available functions of the site, understand how they works Whatch for low-hanging fruits, like unsanitized user inputs (XSS, SQLi) Look for \u0026ldquo;missing\u0026rdquo; pages ","permalink":"https://d0rksec.github.io/writeups/h101/micro-cms_v1/","summary":"A small CMS with very basic functions","title":"Hacker101 - Micro CMS_v1"},{"content":"What A simple, one-page site.\nDifficulty: Trivial\nFlag0 Hint0: Take a look at the source for the page Hit F12 and check Elements tab. Check all sources of the page, even \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;style\u0026gt;. Hint1: Does anything seem out of the ordinary? There is a background-image added to the body element in \u0026lt;style\u0026gt;, but we can\u0026rsquo;t see it rendered.\nHint2: The page looks really plain Is the image even loading? Is it available (Status 200)? Hint3: What is that image? Open the image on a new tab. If you download the image and open it with Chrome, you\u0026rsquo;ll only see a white square.
