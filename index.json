[{"content":"Hi I\u0026rsquo;m Peter, a forty-something years old engineer with electronics manufacturing background. As a hobby, I\u0026rsquo;m interested in cyber security and just started bug bounty hunting. Let\u0026rsquo;s see where it goes - it could be a potential side income, or help a career change to cyber sec.\nThis is my collection of how-to notes, tutorials, learning resources about IT security, Linux, Python etc. It is primarily for me, so don\u0026rsquo;t expect long posts describing everything. But, if you find something useful here, enjoy using it - on your own risk :) Also, I do this to:\ntrack my suffering learning progress in bug bounty hunting (starting almost from zero) get some experience with Hugo and GitHub practice writing in english Note that this is not a repo with a list of materials for \u0026ldquo;how to start in IT security\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;how to start in Bug Bounty\u0026rdquo; - there are way better sites/repositories for this, for example:\nnahamsec 1ndianl33t s0md3v Happy hacking :)\n","permalink":"https://d0rksec.github.io/2021/12/hello-world/","summary":"alert(\u0026ldquo;Hi!\u0026rdquo;)","title":"Hello World!"},{"content":"What A small CMS, with very basic functions.\nDifficulty: Easy\nFlag0 Hint0: Try creating a new page Hit the link Create a new page. Fill out title and content. Click Save button to create the page. Hint1: How are pages indexed? Pages are indexed with ascending numbers in a form of *.ctf.hacker101.com/page/$ (like *.ctf.hacker101.com/page/1, /2, etc.)\nHint2: Look at the sequence of IDs Testing is *.ctf.hacker101.com/page/1.\nMarkdown Test is *.ctf.hacker101.com/page/2.\nThe page we have created starts at *.ctf.hacker101.com/page/11.\nWhat is between page/2 and page/11?\nHint3: If the front door doesn\u0026rsquo;t open, try the window Edit the page ID in the address bar and open page/3, page/4, etc.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll find that *.ctf.hacker101.com/page/5 is Forbidden.\nHint4: In what ways can you retrieve page contents? When you open *.ctf.hacker101.com/page/1 (Testing) or *.ctf.hacker101.com/page/2 (Markdown Test), or on the page you\u0026rsquo;ve created, see that link Edit this page? Open any pages above for editing and check the URL! It is *.ctf.hacker101.com/page/edit/$.\nChange the ID to 5 (*.ctf.hacker101.com/page/edit/5) and collect the first FLAG. Flag1 Hint0: Make sure you tamper with every input What inputs do we have on this site (make a habit of manually looking around on a site)?\nThere are form inputs on Edit Page (*.ctf.hacker101.com/page/edit/$) and on Create Page (*.ctf.hacker101.com/page/create):\nTitle: \u0026lt;input type=\u0026quot;text\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\nText: \u0026lt;textarea name=\u0026quot;body\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\nHint1: Have you tested for the usual culprits? XSS, SQL injection, path injection XSS has worked only on Title field (see FLAG2). There is a comment under the textarea: \u0026ldquo;Markdown is supported, but scripts are not\u0026rdquo;.\nFor SQL injection, see last hint.\nNo luck with path injection.\nHint2: Bugs often occur when an input should always be one type and turns out to be another Title field expects text, javascript worked here (see FLAG2).\nBody textarea accepts only markdown, javascript filtered there.\nURL expects only numbers as page ID.\nHint3: Remember, form submissions aren\u0026rsquo;t the only inputs that come from browsers \u0026hellip; Also, there is the address bar in the browser.\nPut a single apostrophe (') after the page\u0026rsquo;s URL in the address bar, like *.ctf.hacker101.com/page/edit/1' for the FLAG.\nThis simulates the case when a page ID (in this case \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo;) is processed by a backend script and used in an SQL query without sanitizing it first. See more on SQL injection (a very basic injection would be something like *.ctf.hacker101.com/page/edit/1' or 1=1; --), but here, to get the flag, a single apostrophe is enough. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried some basic injection after it without luck.\nFlag2 Hint0: Sometimes a given input will affect more than one page The first input I\u0026rsquo;ve tried has resulted in a FLAG.\nOpen a page for editing, then insert \u0026lt;script\u0026gt;alert('1')\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; into the Title field:\nCreate the page.\nHint1: The bug you are looking for doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in the most obvious place this input is shown You are inserting the XSS on some page\u0026rsquo;s Title field. If you reload the page, nothing happens. Try navigating to the Home page :)\nHome page lists the page titles in an unordered list. List items use Title field values without satitation. This is where our payload kicks in.\nFlag3 Hint0: Script tags are great, but what other options do you have? Using markdown, you can insert URLs, buttons, images on the page.\nIf you load Markdown Test page (*.ctf.hacker101.com/page/2), there is an example for an image (broken) and a button element.\nEdit the page.\nLook up on HTML/JS reference, what inline options you have for a button tag. I\u0026rsquo;ve inserted onclick=\u0026quot;alert('3')\u0026quot; here.\nSave the page, XSS would just work fine. But where\u0026rsquo;s my FLAG?\nCheck the source of the page to get your last FLAG!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also tried XSS on the image element, following this link , but couldn\u0026rsquo;t manage to make it work.\n","permalink":"https://d0rksec.github.io/playground/h101/micro-cms_v1/","summary":"A small CMS with very basic functions","title":"Hacker101 - Micro CMS_v1"},{"content":"What A simple, one-page site.\nDifficulty: Trivial\nFlag0 Hint0: Take a look at the source for the page Hit F12 and check Elements tab. Check all sources of the page, even \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;style\u0026gt;. Hint1: Does anything seem out of the ordinary? There is a background-image added to the body element in \u0026lt;style\u0026gt;, but we can\u0026rsquo;t see it rendered.\nHint2: The page looks really plain Is the image even loading? Is it available (Status 200)? Hint3: What is that image? Open the image on a new tab. If you download the image and open it with Chrome, you\u0026rsquo;ll only see a white square. If you try to open it with an image viewer, it will throw an error.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create a copy from the image and change the file extension from .png to .txt. Now you can open the file with a simple text editor to see your flag.\n","permalink":"https://d0rksec.github.io/playground/h101/get-started/","summary":"Trivial - A little something to get you started","title":"Hacker101 - Get Started"},{"content":"Hugo \u0026lt;3 GitHub Pages With Hugo, I was able to quickly deploy a functional website with plenty of themes to select from. Hugo is somewhere between you build up a site from HTML+CSS+JS by hand and a fully hosted site, where your only job is to edit content in some online Markdown editor. With this setup, you can manually change theme settings or the structure of your content, play with git - if you want.
