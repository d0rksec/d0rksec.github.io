Repository to host my blog, created with Hugo.

I’m a forty-something years old engineer with electronics manufacturing background. As a hobby, I’m interested in cyber security - playing CTFs, doing virtual labs, stuff like that.

This is my collection of how-to notes, tutorials, learning resources about various security-related topics, Linux, Python etc. Treat pages as live documents - they may be updated multiple times after being posted, as I add/re-organize things here. If you find something useful, enjoy using it - on your own risk :)
